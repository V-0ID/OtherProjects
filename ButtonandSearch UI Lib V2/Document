--Load The Library By Using The Loadstring Below
local Library = loadstring(game:HttpGet("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/V-0ID/OtherProjects/main/ButtonandSearch%20UI%20Lib%20V2/init.lua"))();

-- To Create The Window use This Under The LoadString [First parameter means if the gui should be minimized or not when executed [True/False] and the second being the title]
local Window = Library:CreateWindow(true, "Title")


--The only gui part is the button (Not Including Seach Bar) -- Example Below
Window:CreateButton("KillPlayer", function()
    game.Players.LocalPlayer.Character.Humanoid.Health = 0
end)

-- Now it should lok like this

local Library = loadstring(game:HttpGet("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/V-0ID/OtherProjects/main/ButtonandSearch%20UI%20Lib%20V2/init.lua"))();
local Window = Library:CreateWindow(true, "Title")

Window:CreateButton("KillPlayer", function()
    game.Players.LocalPlayer.Character.Humanoid.Health = 0
end)
